# ComfyUI Fooocus Inpaint Wrapper

The best inpaint I found is [Fooocus](https://github.com/lllyasviel/Fooocus)'s one, I've never been able to replicate these results on other GUIs. I did something very simple, this is a simple wrapper of practically all the Fooocus code, probably you could do something more refined, probably in the future I'll do something more refined and lightweight but for now it's like this :)

## Install

    cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
    git clone https://github.com/iacoposk8/ComfyUI-Fooocus-Inpaint-Wrapper
    cd ../..
    .\python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install -r ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Fooocus-Inpaint-Wrapper/Fooocus/requirements_versions.txt
